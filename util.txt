copying lines:
1.commond : yy  => line is copied. to paste it use 'p' commond (p copies the line to next line . P copies before the line (cursor).
2. to paste the copied line n time the use/press : np ie 3p (copied line will be pasted 3 times)
3.undo commond : u
4. dd : deletes the line
5.) :set nu commond used to disply lines in numbers
6) 3yy (nyy) : 3 lines are copied 
7) 3yw : 3 words are copied. to past it user P(caps)
8):/  another search commond
9) :%s   : search and replace  
ex:
:%s/network/bash/   -> here network word replaced with bash.  (but its case sensitive. to replace all the words with caseseinsitive we have to user below commond

:%s/network/bash/gi  (:2s/network/bash/gi will replace bash in second line.
10):wq!  save and come out of the file
11):q!  : dont save the modified file
12) :w (to save the file as ,save as file.)
exp: :w temp/newfile (file directory)

--------------
13)curl  commond is used to browse the url.
ex: curl goole.com


14) To download a file from online use below 
 
curl -o apache-tomcat-9.0.10.tar.gz(file name) http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.10/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.10.tar.gz
 
http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.10/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.10.tar.gz

OR . We can download using wget commond as shown below.

wget http://www-eu.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.10/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.10.tar.gz

size: du -sh filename gives total size of thd directory 
note : wget is not installed initially . to install in use below commond.
sudo yum install wget -y

some times we will have .bz2 files.
to install it use : sudo yum install bzip2 -y
 
 admin related:
 -------------
 1)user management
 2)network management
 3)disk management
 4)package management
 5)service management
 6)file management
 
 in lnux we have two different accounts
 1)root -adminstartor
 2)normal
 
 to add group we should have root permission. to gain root permission user below commond.
 ->sudo groupadd devops(group name)
 to check the group added or not use below commond
 -> cat /etc/group
 
 to add user to the group use below commond.
 ->sudo useradd -g devops(groupname) chandu(user name)
 to check the created user use below commond
 -> id chandu
 
the result is :uid=1002(chandu) gid=1003(devops) groups=1003(devops)

to add user chandu to other group use below one.
-> sudo usermod -a -G sales chandu -> now user chandu is added to the sales group
now chandu is added to two groups as shown below..
->uid=1002(chandu) gid=1003(devops) groups=1003(devops),1004(sales)
lst of user are available in /etc/password

to move to root user use 

->sudo su -	

to logout use: -> logout
to switch a user user -> su - chandu(user)
to set password for the user use below :
->sudo passwd chandu123(pwd)

cat /var/log/secure

Disk management
-----------------

sudo fdisk -l -> gives disk (partition on the system)
output is: Disk /dev/sda
-> to create a partition use: sudo fdisk /dev/sda
it will ask for option , give m . and to create new partition give n option

Inorder to use newly created partition we have to farmate it. use below commond to format.
-> sudo mks /dev/sda1 (newly created partition)
now the next step is to use partition we have to mount it.

1)sudo mkdir /data
2)sudo mount /dev/sda1 /data
now got the data directory . (cd /data)

df -h /df -hT  -> check disk size

Network Management
-------------------
ip a -> gives ip address

Package management
----------------------
in redhat packages are called rpms - redhat package management
te
To check what are all the packages(installed) available for update use below commond.
-> sudo yum check-update

there are 64 bit and 32 bit packages are available . we can install 32 package in 64 bit package . not vice-versa
to check system is 64 or 32 bit . user below commond.
-> uname -a 

sample output :
Linux devinstance 3.10.0-862.9.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Jul 16 16:29:36 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

To update package use below commond

sudo yum update -y ( in real time we need shudown time.)
sudo yum update package name -y (to update perticular package)
sudo yum list installed (gives all installed packages)
sudo yum list available (shows available packages to  install)
sudo yum remove packagename -y(remove the package)

(@packagename means that package is alredy installed, other wise its a package to be installed)

-> packages are configured in repos files(cd /etc/yum.repos.d/)


ERROR:

.No free sectors available

 /dev/sda1 is mounted; will not make a filesystem here!
 
 
 
-------------------
 A service is nothing but which servers something . like Databse service which is used by end user. 
 
 Deamon server : which runs in the background.
 
 ->sudo systemctl status sshd(service)
 
 output : ● sshd.service - OpenSSH server daemon
 To stop the service use below commond:
 sudo systemctl stop sshd
  To start the service use below commond:
  sudo systemctl start sshd
  
 There are 0 to 65535 ports are there . and ther servuce can listen to any of the port.
 
 -> sudo netstat -l  -> commond gives all the listeninh ports.
-sudo netstat -lt 
 -sudo netstat -ltn
 0 to 1023 are well know ports.
 cat /etc/services
 
 sudo yum install httpd(package) -y
 
 NOTE: TO start any service that package should be install first.
 
1) commond: sudo yum install httpd -y
2)start the service -> sudo yum start httpd
3) we can check whether the service is running or not by using below commond
sudo systemctl list-units -t service | grep http ->

to chec whether the port is opened by process/service use below.
->sudo systemctl status httpd -> output : Main PID: 2096 (httpd)
->sudo netstat -ltnp ->output : tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      2096/httpd          

  here MainPID(2096) and LISTEN port(2069) are matching . it means that the port 2096 is used by httpd service.
  
 -> kill -l -> gives signals 
 
 sudo reboot -> reboots/restar the system
 
 File management
 ----------------
 ugo -owner group other
 
 ugo+r sample ->  give read access to every one.

 

CREATING WEBSERVER
-------------------

To create a webserver  

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxautomations/scripts/master/init.sh | sudo bash  


afterexcuting the above common server will reboot. and after 15 secs reconnect.  to check the server is back use below command.

-> uptime
 15:11:53 up 2 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.02, 0.03, 0.02

 to shudown the server user command - > sudo init 0(zero)
 
 while createing a image the server sould be down.

 
 Intstalling webserver:
 -----------------------
 1)switch to root user 
 sudo su -
 2)yum install httpd(its package to install web server) -y
 3)start the webservice. before starting the service we should enable the service so that the service will start automatically whe system reboots.
  systemctl enable httpd
 4)start httpd
 systemctl sratt httpd .
 5)TO check whether the service is tarted or not use below
 systemctl status httpd
 6)netstat -lntp  -> gives service port no.
 7)every service will have configuratoin file. 
 cd /ect/httpd. and the conf.d file contains all the service information like listen port ects..
 8)we can change the configuratoin file but we should restart once to reflect the changes
 9)in conf.d file ->DocumetRoot is there which contains all the sources(webcontent).
 ex: DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
10)in this directory we have to create indext.htm file . save the file and change the mode.
11) to test it copy the external ip and put in the browser and u will get index.html content.
12)loog file location -> /var/log

Installing apache tomcat server( application sever)
-------------------------------------------------
1)before intallig tomcat check whether its available or not.
yum list all | grep tomcat
2) to install tomcat we require java,
yum install java -yum
3)yum install tomcat -y 
4)systemctl enable tomcat
5)systemctl status tomcat
6)apache tomcat open 3 ports.
7)in tomcat9 web content is availabe in -> /root/apache-tomcat-9.0.10/webapps
8)log path for tomcat -> /root/apache-tomcat-9.0.10/logs -> it may differ version to version
9)yum remove tomcat 
10)deplopy your application in webapps folder.
ex: webapps/student  -> to access the student application use below url.
http://35.237.169.181:8080/student/

Trainer Notes:
==================

We need total three servers.
1. WebServer
2. AppServer
3. DBServer
1. Install Web Server
# yum install httpd -y
# systemctl enable httpd
# systemctl start httpd
Open this server over browser wiht external ip address.

2. Install App Server.
# cd /root
# wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.10/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.10.tar.gz
# tar -xf apache-tomcat-9.0.10.tar.gz
# cd apache-tomcat-9.0.10/webapps
# wget https://github.com/citb30/project-1/raw/master/student.war
# cd /root/apache-tomcat-9.0.10/bin
# sh startup.sh
# tail -f /root/apache-tomcat-9.0.10/logs/catalina.out

=====================================================

11)TO Check apache tomcat application server running or not we have to grep java.
ex: ps -ef | grep java -> it gives running processes of the server
12) To check the server ports and default port is 8080 ->
 netstat -lntp
13) tomcat server service not registered with yum command .hence automatic restart of the server will not happen with systemctl command . inorder to do restart the
server automatically we have to write out own script.
 13) to connect any DB we should dow the Driver
 14)install mariadb-server -your
 yum install mariadb-server -your
 systemctl enable mariadb
 systemctl start mariadb
